* PHP 8.3 or higher
* Laravel 11.0 or higher

### Step 1: Composer Installation <a href="#step-1-composer-installation" id="step-1-composer-installation"></a>

First, let's add Revisor to your project using Composer. Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run:

```bash
composer require indracollective/laravel-revisor
```

If you'll be using Revisor in Filament, run this command instead:

```bash
composer require indracollective/laravel-revisor-filament
```

### Step 2: Publish the Configuration <a href="#step-2-publish-the-configuration" id="step-2-publish-the-configuration"></a>

Revisor comes with a configuration file that you may want to customise. Publish it to your config directory by running:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="revisor-config"
```
